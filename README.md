# Building Defect Detection

## Introduction
The Building Defect Detection project aims to classify buildings based on the presence of cracks. It utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network model as a transfer learning technique to achieve accurate and interpretable results. By detecting building defects, this project contributes to improving safety standards, preventing future defects, and providing recommendations for remedial actions.

You will you this project through the web interface, where you can upload an image and you can get whether there are building defects or not.

## Key Features
- Classification of buildings into two categories: cracked and not cracked
- Transfer learning using the VGG16 model for accurate and interpretable results
- Scalability and robustness for handling diverse building images
- Performance analysis with metrics such as accuracy.
- Interpretability analysis to understand the model's decision-making process
